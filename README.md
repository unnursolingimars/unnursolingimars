# Hi, I'm Unnur Sól 👋

**Creative Frontend Engineer** at **[Origo](https://www.origo.is)** specializing in **React, Next.js, TypeScript** and **design systems** — turning complex product logic into accessible, reusable UI architectures.

> Currently: Building scalable, accessible UI platforms and design system foundations at Origo.

## 🔭 Focus
- Building and evolving design systems (tokens, theming, semantics, documentation)
- High-quality, accessible interfaces (WCAG minded, performance aware)
- Structured component architecture in monorepos (Nx) with strong typing

## 🛠 Core Stack
`React` · `Next.js` · `TypeScript` · `Vanilla Extract` · `GraphQL` · `REST` · `Storybook` · `Playwright` · `Cypress` · `Vite` · `Webpack` · `Docker` · `Azure DevOps` · `GitHub Actions`

## 📦 Also Worked With
`Prismic` · `WordPress` · `Payload` · `MongoDB` · `Firestore` · `NextAuth` · `Auth0` · `Algolia` · `.NET Core` · `Figma`

## 🌐 Selected Work
- Icelandic Meteorological Office – new site from the ground up
- Smári (TR) – insurance case processing system
- Ylja (TR) – external communication portal
- Digital Iceland – application workflows
- VÍS – calculators + application flows
- Auður – external site + financial calculator
- Origo.is – corporate site

## 🧪 Quality & DX
I care deeply about **consistency**, **testability**, and **maintainability**. I leverage Storybook for isolated UI iteration, pair it with automated regression suites, and bake accessibility checks into pipelines.

## 🎨 Intersection of Code & Art
I explore the overlap between form and function—shaping interfaces that *feel* calm and purposeful.

## 🤝 Collaboration
Agile/Scrum practitioner with strong code review and mentorship habits. I enjoy lifting team capability through shared patterns and clear abstractions.

## 💼 Currently @ Origo
At Origo I focus on:
- Establishing reusable component foundations across product surfaces
- Improving accessibility baselines and semantic structure
- Streamlining developer experience (linting, testing, Storybook workflows)
- Mentoring teammates on scalable UI patterns
